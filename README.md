<h1 style="text-align: center;">[WIP] Stremio Enhanced</h1>

## What is stremio enhanced ?
basically a stremio client with plugins and themes support,
it runs the stremio streaming server and opens this [url](https://app.strem.io/shell-v4.4) in electron (i know its probably not the best way to do it, but thats just how i got it working).

with this project you can something cool like this:

## Downloads
you can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced/releases)
or build it yourself
```
git clone https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced.git

```

## "Your code sucks"
